# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive authentication system for the Barber Hub application. The system will provide user registration, login, profile management, and role-based access control. It includes both manual authentication with email verification and Google OAuth integration, along with profile picture management through Cloudinary.

2. WHEN I upload a profile picture THEN the system SHALL store it in Cloudinary
3. WHEN a picture is uploaded THEN the system SHALL store both the URL and public_id in MongoDB
4. WHEN I update my profile picture THEN the system SHALL delete the old image from Cloudinary

3. WHEN API routes are created THEN they SHALL follow RESTful conventions and best practices
4. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL include proper error handling
5. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI accordingly
